Group Mates Kyle Du, James Parrott, Logan Dinh 

The project is called CarQueen. Users on the website can interact with a list of cars. The users can read the car's price, mileage, safety, and other specifications. Users on the website can upload vehicles to the site and compare the specifications of any two cars side by side.

The functionality that CarQueen possesses will be a search feature for the home page. It will allow a user to search for a specific card and it will display that car's more info page. Additionally the user can use the clear function and clear the search bar.
