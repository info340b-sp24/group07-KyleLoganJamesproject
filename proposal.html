            <p>Our goal is to have this app display car information in a clear and concise manner. This aims to help people better understand car information and car pricing models. Then with this knowledge, people will have a better understanding about their price. It will help people improve their bargaining at dealerships. Our app can also help a person understand their cars value and they can use that information to bargain for a better trade-in value. Our app will improve people’s experiences at car dealerships.</p>
